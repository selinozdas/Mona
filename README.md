# Mona: The artwork project
The drastic increase in the number of artworks that are digitized created a data
pool. This pool required people to find ways to retrieve and archive the data.
Artists use different concepts to describe paintings such as texture, colors,
patterns and balance. The main problem caused by this situation is that some
features may give high variations. Mona is a categorization tool of fine art
paintings in terms of their specifications such as genre, style etc. by processing
visual features. To demonstrate Mona, we are going to use a publicly available
dataset from Kaggle which is Painter by Numbers prepared by Kiri Nichol.
